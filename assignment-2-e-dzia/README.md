### Tasks

1. (2 point) **Data.** Using appropriate python module acquire Twitter dataset about parliament candidates activity on Twitter. Please consider the following candidates that have been discovered by teaching team: 
```python
[ProtasiewiczJ, RozeckaPL, K_Smiszek, TudujKrzysztof, SchetynadlaPO]
```
This is not the full list of candidates, it consist of the first candidates from list but Ewa Zdrojewska (Bezpoartyjni SamorzÄ…dowcy), who we were not able to find on Twitter.

*Expected outcome:* a good quality raw dataset, with appropriate scope (see requirements in following tasks) for all candidates

2. (5 points) **Analysis & Visualization**:

A. Show the number of tweets in time (x axis) for candidates using any line plot; show the number of re-tweets in time (x axis) for candidates using any line plot

B. Show the popularity of tweets in time (number of likes, number of retweets) - likes assigned to tweet's publication date

C. Show the distribution of activity in the scope of a day (on an hourly basis) and week (on a daily basis) for tweeting and retweeting activities (both)

*Expected outcome:* a set of good quality visualization, easy to interpret, with appropriate axis description 

3. (4 points) **Sentiment analysis.** Using appropriate python module show visualization of tweet sentiment (average) in time for all candidates. This is a simple evaluation of sentiment, no need to consider entities (aspects). Provide your explanation and objective interpretation. Check also the sentiment of comments (responses) to posts if you have collected appropiate data.

*Expected outcome:* a good quality visualization of sentiment distribution for all candidates (posts and separatelly comments)
